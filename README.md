# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to construct a movie recommendation system that offers personalized suggestions to users based on their movie ratings. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes user preferences and movie similarities to generate curated lists of the top 5 movie recommendations for each user.

## Business Understanding
In the age of streaming services, users often face difficulty in discovering movies aligned with their tastes. Movie recommendation systems address this challenge by providing personalized suggestions, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. Streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu can benefit from implementing these systems to improve customer retention and gain a competitive edge.

## Data Understanding
### Source
- The dataset is obtained from GroupLens.
- Dataset link: [MovieLens Latest Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)

### Dataset Details
- **Name:**Dataset
- **Description:** Contains 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies, generated by 610 users between March 29, 1996, and September 24, 2018.
- **Files:** 
  - **links.csv**: Contains movie links
  - **movies.csv**: Contains movie information (title, genres)
  - **ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for movies
  - **tags.csv**: Contains user-generated tags for movies

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries (such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are installed.
3. Clone or download the project repository.
4. Place the dataset files (`links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`) in the project directory.
5. Run the movie recommendation system script.

## Implementation Details
- The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences.
- Machine learning algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are utilized to generate movie recommendations.
- Evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are used to assess the performance of the recommendation models.
- The system provides users with personalized movie recommendations based on their historical ratings and similarities between movies.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate deep learning models for improved recommendation accuracy.
- Implement real-time recommendation updates based on user interactions.
- Enhance the user interface for seamless navigation and interaction.
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., user demographics, movie reviews) for more comprehensive recommendations.
